<h1>TOP Foundations Landing Page Assignment</h1>
<p>The TOP landing page assignment was a great way for me to learn how to organize html in a way that optimizes CSS styling</p>
<p>Before starting on the landing page, I was still having difficulty predicting how various flexbox parameters would change the layout of each container. However, as I worked my way through the assignment, it became easier to predict which flex settings would yield the desired layout.</p>
